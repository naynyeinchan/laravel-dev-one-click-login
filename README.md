# Add easy login function during development

When we are developing a laravel app, we might need to enter email + password combination to login to our system during
development stage and that may make developer himself to be annoyed.

<h4 style="color: #f70d1a">!!! Important this package is only available for development purpose.Please do not use it in production.Delete component
when you are ready to deploy your app. !!!</h4>


This package can help you to overcome those problems by providing the following component.

```blade
    <x-dev-login identifier="someone@somewhere.com"/>
```

Once the user click the button generated by the x-dev-login component, you are authenticated as your desired user
account.

You can loop through the users in your database to generate the x-dev-login component.


```blade
    @foreach($foo as $bar)
            <x-dev-login
                identifier="{{$bar->email}}"
                label="Login in as {{$bar->name}}"
            />
    @endforeach
```

You can also pass attributes to the components as following.

```blade
    <x-dev-login 
        identifier="heidi.connelly@example.net"
        identifier-column="email" 
        redirect-url="{{route('home')}}"
        label="Login as heidi"
        guard="web"
        class="bg-primary"
    />
```

The definitions of the component attributes are as follows.

- identifier - value to be used to be authenticated (mostly user email)
- identifier-column - mysql column to be validated with identifier mentioned above.
- redirect-url - url to be redirected after authenticating the user
- label - label to show on button
- guard - guard to be used when trying to authenticate
- class - class for the component blade

# Note

All the attributes listed above are optional and the very first user in the table will be used to be authenticated by
default if no attribute is passed.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer.

```bash
composer require naynyeinchan/laravel-dev-one-click-login
```

Optionally, you can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="dev-login"
```

Here is how to override the package.

```php
<?php

use NayThuKhant\LaravelDevLogin\Http\Controllers\DevLoginController;

/*all the config are not getting from Env helper since this application should not be messing up the env file*/

return [
    /*default route name to be redirected after logging in*/
    "redirect_route_name" => null,

    /*controller for handling the request,
     invoke function of this controller will be called by default*/
    "login_controller" => DevLoginController::class,

    /*default guard for authentication
    this guard is really important because it works together with application authentication config*/
    "guard" => "web",

    /*default model to authenticate*/
    "auth_model" => null,

    /*this middleware will be applied for the dev login route*/
    "middleware" => 'web',
    
    /*this is login view where package will be use*/
    "view_path" => 'auth.login',
    
    /*this will define variable name to be looped*/
    "var_name" => 'foo',
    
    /*this will define which column to be use for loop*/
    "column_name" => 'role',
    
    /*this will define when to include things provided by this package*/
    "allowed_environments" => ['local']
];

```
